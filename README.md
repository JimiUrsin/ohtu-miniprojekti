### User guide
The application has been developed and tested with Python version `3.9`. 

Using the application requires Python version `3.9` (or newer) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) installed on the system.

The dependencies must be installed before the first launch by typing a following command to terminal:
```shell

```

Then the application can be launched by typing a following command:
```shell
poetry run python3 src/main.py
```

When the application launches, there are three choices:

When browsing a recommendations, choosing "Browse recommendations" prints all the recommendations saved in the application.
